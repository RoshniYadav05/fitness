                <h3>Trade Mill</h3>
                <p>~ The treadmill allows a user to walk or run in place on the machine on a belt that moves underneath the feet in a continuous loop.<br>
                    <br>~ All aspects of the workout can be controlled by the user: speed, incline, warm up period, cool down period, and energy spend.<br>
                <br>~ The treadmill has a predictable surface that is much easier to negotiate than sidewalks, curbs or trails and the risk of tripping is reduced.</p>

                <h3>Chest press</h3>
                <p>~ The chest press machine is a similar motion to a push-up.<br>
                    <br>~ If youâ€™re new to working out, building up your chest, your biceps, and even your triceps will be helpful for doing compound movements later on.<br>
                <br>~ The chest press is one of the best chest exercises for building upper body strength.</p>

                <h3>Hanging leg raise</h3>
                <p>~ The hanging knee raise is among the best exercises for targeting the lower abs while working out your entire core. This exercise also builds excellent forearm and grip strength.<br>
                <br>~ Performing hanging knee raises with proper technique counteracts the tendency of the lower back to arch by strengthening the muscles that oppose this movement.</p>

            <h3>Dumbbells</h3>
            <p>~ Dumbbells are small bars that fit in your hand and have equal weights on either side. They weigh as little as 2 pounds and go up to over 100 pounds.<br>

        <h3>Horizontal seated leg press</h3>
        <p>~ The horizontal leg press is beginner-friendly and simple to operate, making it an excellent choice for individuals new to weightlifting.<br>
        <br>~ The reclined position provides more support to the lower back, reducing the risk of strain or injury.<br>
    <br>~ The weight is more directly applied to the legs, potentially increasing the effectiveness of the exercise.<br>
   <br>~ The 45-degree angle engages more muscles in the lower body, including the glutes and hamstrings.</p>

        <h3>Lat pulldown</h3>
        <p>~ The seated cable row is a pulling exercise that works the back muscles. This machine also works the forearm muscles and the upper arm muscles.<br>
            <br>~ Lat pull downs are a highly effective exercise for improving upper body strength.<br>
            <br>~ They work the muscles of the back, shoulders, arms, and core, and can help to improve posture, stability, and grip strength.</p>
